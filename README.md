## Abstract 
> Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) is challenging due to structural relationships, implicit symbols, and handwriting styles. Therefore, this paper presents a novel combining multi-task learning with advanced attention mechanisms, including the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) integrated into the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), which optimizes attention mechanisms, context-aware interpretation, and generalization of architecture. Integrating multi-task learning enhances the model's ability to work well on the main task. By sharing knowledge across tasks, the model reduces overfitting leads to better generalization in the inference stage. Advanced attention mechanisms refine the attention distribution to capture highly complex structure expressions and implicit correction. Our approach addresses the limitations of traditional methods and demonstrates improving the expression recognition rate on CROHME data sets. Experimental results show that our model has competitive performance and lower parameters when compared with state-of-the-art.
